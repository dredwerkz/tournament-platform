# Unnamed tournament platform prototype
Actual software dev hasn't really started yet, however planning is mostly done!


### Objectives

 - Most discord-oriented tournament platforms have extremely basic functionality, and aren't suitable for use in commercial competitive environments
   - The use-case for this platform is to be able to drop a discord bot into a server, assign admin users and initialise a fully structured tournament across multiple titles, and different tiers of competition.
 - The intended environment is large LAN tournaments, such as Insomnia and Epic.LAN, where the mixture of communications and tournament platforms often causes confusion and difficulty between stakeholders
   - Integrating a trustworthy tournament platform _into_ the communications platform of choice reduces risk and increases product quality.
 - An opportunity to learn WebSocket and best practices when integrating a deployed product with a 3rd party platform.
